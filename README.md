This repository contains a collection of sessions from my data structures and algorithms lab classes, featuring a variety of projects and exercises that were completed during the course. The exercises cover a range of topics, such as sorting algorithms, linked lists, trees, and more, and are designed to help students understand and implement different data structures and algorithms.

One of the main projects featured in this repository is a travel booking system. This project was completed as the final project for the lab sessions and enables users to book flights, rental cars, and other transportation options. It allows users to select from the cheapest or most comfortable (expensive) options for their trip. And also prompts them to sign in as an admin to insert destinations along with their prices. To access the project, please download the "project.cpp" and "password.txt" files together. Alternatively, you can use the pre-compiled executable file "Project.exe", but be sure to download and save the "password.txt" file in the same location.

In addition to the travel booking system project, this repository also includes other exercises and projects that are designed to help students gain practical experience in working with data structures and algorithms. By exploring this repository and completing the exercises, you can enhance your programming skills and become more proficient in implementing different data structures and algorithms.
